# Curmudgeon

> **curmudgeon** - an ill tempered, cantankerous person

Curmudgeon is web framework built entirely in C. No C++. I decided to do this for a few reasons:

* I hate slow things, after 5 years of Rails, I was pretty effing fed up.
* Everyone said it would be hard, impossible, couldn't work.
* No one, to my knowledge has ever really tried. (RAPHTERs, while cool, is not really the same)
